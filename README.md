# Purpose of this project

This project acts as a frontend to search for available rooms at the University of applied Sciences Jena (EAH Jena). Until recently there was no possibility of finding available rooms that don't have classes being held. Even though there's now a way (there wasn't one when I've started this project), this project is to be seen as an improved solution that offers more information in less clicks and more possible filtering options of the results while being more aesthetically pleasing.

# Why?

I was not satisfied with the current solution provided by my university
and took this as a opportunity to learn Python among other things.
Therefore: my Code wont be that good as I have little to no experience using Python.
Feel free to raise any bugs or suggestions for improvement.
