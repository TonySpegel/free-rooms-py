# Purpose of this project

This script is used to download and handle ics-calendar files provided by
the Ernst-Abbe-Hochschule Jena to process them into JSON files.
These JSON-files are the backbone of a Web-App to show users available
rooms at this university

# Why?

I was not satisfied with the current solution provided by my university
and took this as a opportunity to learn Python among other things.
Therefore: my Code wont be that good. Feel free to raise any bugs or suggestions for improvement.
