# Purpose of this project

This project will act as a frontend to search for available rooms at the 
University of applied Sciences Jena. Until recently there was no possibility
of finding available rooms that don't have classes being held. Even though 
there's now a way (there wasn't one when I've started this project),
this project is to be seen as an improved solution that offers more information
in less clicks and more possible filtering options of the results while being more
aesthetically pleasing.
